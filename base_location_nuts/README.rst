NUTS Regions
============

This module allows to import NUTS locations.

Creates four new fields in Partner object, one per NUTS level

* NUTS L1: Country level
* NUTS L2: Normally state or big region level
* NUTS L3: Normally substate or state level
* NUTS L4: Normally small region or province level


Installation
------------






We recommend to install another addon (one for each country) in order to relate
NUTS with states defined by each localization addon, for example:

* l10n_es_location_nuts : Spanish Provinces (NUTS level 4) related to Partner State
* l10n_de_location_nuts : German states (NUTS level 2) related to Partner State


Configuration
-------------






After installation, you must click at import wizard to populate NUTS items
in Odoo database in:
Sales > Configuration > Address Book > Import NUTS 2013

This wizard will download from Europe RAMON service the metadata to
build NUTS in Odoo. Each localization addon (l10n_es_location_nuts,
l10n_de_location_nuts, ...) will inherit this wizard and
relate each NUTS item with states. So if you install a new localization addon
you must re-build NUTS clicking this wizard again.


Usage
-----







=====

Only Administrator can manage NUTS list (it is not neccesary because
it is an European convention) but any registered user can read them,
in order to allow to assign them to partner object.
