Contacts' Personal Information Page
===================================

This module extends the contact management functionality.

Its only purpose is to serve as a base for other modules that add personal
information fields to **contacts that are persons**.

Ultimately, this module is no longer required in version 9, as each module
that was previously dependent upon it will declare what it needs for itself.

Installation
------------






This module exists to ensure that upgraded databases continue to work.
There should be no reason to install it directly, and there should be no
modules depending on it.

Configuration
-------------






There is no configuration required for this module.

Usage
-----







=====

You can find a new page called *Personal Information* in the contact's form.
